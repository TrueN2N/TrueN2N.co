        <h3 className="About-header">Domain of focus: </h3>
        <p className="cypherpunk">
        Intersection of decentralized (dx) protocols & AI. 
        <br></br>
        Sub-domain: Frictionlessly unlocking value efficiency (scale, scope etc.) in n dimensions. <br>

        <h3 className="About-header">What is N:N?</h3>  
        <p className="cypherpunk">N:N is a trading/market ideal. 'N-sided' protocol markets. It's direct value exchange between any (n) two assets. It unlocks direct value relations between any protocol-enabled assets. 
        <br>
        <i>Familiar examples: </i><br>
        &nbsp;Direct exchange: AAPL/USD → AAPL/ETH; <br>
        &nbsp;Derivatives: ETH/USD Futures → ETH/TokenizedUtility. ETH Call Option w/ strike price in BTC.<br>
        &nbsp;Previously illiquid, non-fungible assets: [Tokenized Land Equity]/[Tokenized Condo Equity]<br>
        &nbsp;Direct margin/futures hedging: [Crypto-Collaterized Debt Position]/[Tokenized Dividend-Reaping Asset], [Tokenized Student Loan]/[Tokenized Identity-tied Future Income] <br> 
        </p>  

        <h3 className="About-header">N:N Specs:</h3> 
        Founded: Feb. 2018. <br>
        Currently: 3-5 entrepreneurs.<br>
        Focus: Private pre-seed & protocol markets.<br>
        Where? Toronto headquarters.<br>
        Fund Size: >$3M in liquid, personally contributed Capital (>3000% aggregate personal ROIs yoy). N:N is beholden to zero outside influence or shareholders at this time. <br>
        



 
        <h3 className="About-header">What does N:N collective seek to do?</h3>
        Shift nascent N:N market state toward meritocratic efficiency. <br>
        We seek to accellerate, truth-orient & compound value creation events. We seek to build connectivity [pipes, tools, models/intelligence] &capitalize on inefficency/illiquidity [arbitrage]. <br>
        We're entering a wild west period as the manifold state of intersecting n-sided protocol markets emerge. <br> 
        
        Fundamental elements of society go natively digitial -> Complex & obscure n-sided protocol markets manifest --> application of tools & intelligence --> real time truth-aligned global manifold state changes --> accellerated compounding of value creation events = new equilibrium in value creation rate trajectory. <br>



        Domains & institutions primarily oriented toward steady state efficency & rent-seeking will have their relative value brought to light under shaky footing. <br> Our supposition: we're hyperbolically evolving toward protocol-enabled meritocracy. And under such conditions it's dynamism & anti-fragility that confer true 1st principles value. <br>
        

         <h3 className="About-header">Collective?</h3>
        <p className="cypherpunk">Free flowing group of individuals with overlapping access to resources & a shared mission to create.</p>
        
        <h3 className="About-header">Our conjecture:</h3>
        <p className="cypherpunk">Trajectory will be primarily be determined by: <br>
        &nbsp;a. Data access/flow; Networks [hardware & wetware]. <br>
        &nbsp;b. Intelligence; AI</p>

      
        
        <h3 className="About-header">What is N:N building?</h3>
        <p className="cypherpunk">Currently: N:N dx protocol tooling. Non-fungible asset networks (i.e. property registry, non-fungible private equity tokenization). AI guided, automated resource allocation over dx protocols (i.e. dynamic relaying/market making). Stablecoin debt tooling.<br>
        <b>Note</b>: N:N honours absolute autonomy. No one but the builders involved determine & manage endeavour-specific disclosure.
        </p>

        <h3 className="About-header">High level 'How':</h3>
        <p className="cypherpunk"> 
        Ground-up reasoning. Unlearning. (i.e iterative dynamism > static determinism). Building + supporting truth-seeking ventures. <br>
        Process goals > Outcome goals. Keep identity ‘small’. Improvised, swift action.
        </p>

        <h3 className="About-header">Low level 'How':</h3>
        <p className="cypherpunk">
           Modelling [compressed intelligence]. Dynamic, iterative automation. Dynamic, rapidly deployed peripheral tooling. Building expediantly on cutting-edge protocol improvement proposals (i.e. state channels, ERC 821, ring signatures). Dynamic mechanism design & implementation [incentives/cryptoeconomics]. Wield non-obvious force multipliers. Network creation.<br>

        </p> 

        <h3 className="About-header">Why?</h3> 
        <p className="cypherpunk">Timing. <br>
        We’re in period of punctuated equilibrium. <i> "There are decades in which nothing happens and weeks in which decades happen"-V.Lenin </i><br>
        Current potential impact on Global state trajectory per unit time is 
        [arguably] at a local maximum. <br> 
        At peak actionability, we're employing force-weighted multipliers/leverage, namely: <br>
        &nbsp;<center><tt><b> labour < capital < {fundamental dx protocols/ai ⊆ code} </tt> → maximal trajectory-influence.</b></p> </center></tt> <br>
